    <h1>Why I Love You, Baby 💖</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
      I love you because you're one of the greatest and cutest human beings to ever exist.I adore your entire existence.
I love how you get shy, how you make me feel like I belong to you, and how you express your love so beautifully.
I love your kisses... the way you talk, the way you never raise your voice at me.
Your voice calms me like nothing else.
I love the way we laugh together, your jokes, your humor.
Whenever you call me baby, my heart skips a beat.
Even the way you say my name,it sounds so beautiful in your voice.
I love how you listen to all my yapping and still ask me about my day, about everything.
You never get bored of me—even though I feel like I'm boring sometimes and that means everything.
You're truly the best.


  <h3> <b>You're the best thing that’s ever happened to me, and I love you endlessly. 💗</b></h3>
